### Verify
We use `detekt` for static code analyis and a job is setup in github actions to run it on every PR. You can run it locally using the following command:
```bash
// For android related changes
./gradlew detekt

// For iOS related changes
./gradlew detektMetadataIosMain

// For common code changes
./gradlew detektMetadataCommonMain
```

If you want to `detekt` to auto correct some of the stuff, please add the flag `--auto-correct` to the above commands.
